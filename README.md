## About
The focus of this project was to implement a portable and smart drinking water quality monitoring system,
in order to address the lack of availability of such product and the disadvantages of using conventional
paper test strips to measure water quality. The developed system consists of multiple sensors that infer
useful measurements about the water quality, conveniently built into a water bottle, as well as a mobile
application that provides an intuitive user interface for the user to interact with the system. This enabled
the users to be confident in the quality of water they intend to consume, without compromising
convenience or ease of use.

## Features
- Measures water quality in real time
- Sensors and other hardware components built into a water bottle for convenience
- Precisely calibrated and thoroughly tested for high accuracy
- Utilizes a rechargable battery for portability
- Simple and intuitive user interface design
- Compatible with both Android and IOS devices
